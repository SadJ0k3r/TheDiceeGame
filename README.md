/**
 * TheDiceeGame - A Simple Dice Game
 * 
 * This JavaScript program creates a fun and interactive dice game where two players roll a dice to determine the winner.
 * It uses the Math.random() function to generate random numbers representing dice rolls and dynamically updates the web page based on the results.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * - When the web page loads, the script waits for the DOM to be fully loaded.
 * - It then generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, one for each player.
 * - Based on these numbers, it selects the corresponding dice images and updates the image elements on the page.
 * - The script checks if the image elements exist before attempting to set their source attributes.
 * - It determines the winner by comparing the two random numbers and updates the page's heading with the result.
 * - If there's a draw, it displays a draw message.
